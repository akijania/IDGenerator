# Random ID generator
Random ID Generator is a function that generates a long random string of letters and numbers. The function takes one argument "idLength" which will decide on the number of characters in ID.


### Installing Random ID Generator

To install generator from npm, run:

```
npm install @akijania/randomid-generator
```

### Example

```
console.log("random ID", randomID(5));
```

You should get a random string of 5 characters e.g. 8WkBH

```
console.log("random ID", randomID());
```
If you don't pass any parameter, you get a random string of 7 characters.
